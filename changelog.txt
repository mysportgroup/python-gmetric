    * reformat code to be more eye-candy ;)
    * Let the Gmetric Class inherit from object
    * rename the "type" Gmetric Class attribute to "types",
      which is more secure (can not be missinterpreted
      with the builtin "type" call).
    * changes Exceptions to use string formatiing and uses ', '.join()
      to concate list entries.
    * use ' for strings insted of " (which is just a personal choice)
    * using "if not NAME" insted of "if len(NAME) == 0"
    * fix a bug with self.slope.keys() which does not exists in Gmetric.send
    * refactor everything to fullfil the 80 chars per line limit
    * add short args to OptionParser (where possible)
    * add a version string (usable for gmetric --version)
